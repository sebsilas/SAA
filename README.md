# Singing Ability Assessment (SAA)

The `SAA` is a test of singing ability which can be launched in R/Shiny via the [`psychTestR`](https://github.com/pmcharrison/psychTestR) package.

## Demos

Short `SAA` with feedback: https://adaptiveeartraining.com/SAA-demo

Prototype adaptive-`SAA`(*aSAA*) with feedback: https://adaptiveeartraining.com/aSAA

## Installation

1. Install *nodeJS*: https://nodejs.org/en/download/

2. Install *R*: https://cloud.r-project.org/

3. Install *RStudio*: https://posit.co/downloads/

4. Launch *RStudio*

5. Install the `devtools` *R* package by pasting the following command into the *RStudio* terminal:

`install.packages('devtools')`

6. Install the `SAA` package:

`devtools::install_github('sebsilas/SAA')`


## Usage

Once you have completed the above steps, you can run the `SAA` test by doing the following:

1. Create a folder which will contain your app. The name of this folder will become the `app_name` argument when you run the `SAA` or `SAA_standalone` functions later.

2. In the folder, create an *R* file called `app.R`. In this file, paste your code to run the `SAA` there, like below:


``` r

# Load the SAA package

library(SAA)

# Run a short test with feedback:

SAA_standalone(app_name = "my_SAA_app",
               num_items = list(long_tones = 2L, arrhythmic = 2L, rhythmic = 2L),
               feedback = TRUE,
               SNR_test = FALSE,
               get_range = FALSE,
               musicassessr_aws = FALSE,
               examples = 0)

```

Remember that the `app_name` argument should match the name of your folder.

3. Make sure that your current directory is the app folder you created. You can check the current directory by using `getwd()`. You may need to set the app directory by placing `setwd('/Users/musicassessr/my_project/my_SAA_app')` at the beginning of your app file. 

4. Run the app. To do this in *RStudio*, use the shortcut `Command + Shift + Enter` on Mac (`Ctrl + Shift + Enter` on Windows).


5. If the above steps were successful, the `SAA` test should load in your web browser, and as you progress through the test, you should receive feedback after each trial. Recorded audio should appear in the */app_name/www/audio/* directory.

If not, go to our [Troubleshooting]() page or [raise an issue on Github](https://github.com/sebsilas/SAA/issues).

## Usage notes

- The test requires internet connectivity. 

- The *SAA* runs in your web browser. It is only recommended to run the test in [Google Chrome](https://www.google.com/chrome/) or [Opera](https://www.opera.com/download). You will need to set one of these to be your default browser for *RStudio* to launch the test there (restart *RStudio* after doing this).



## Citation

We advise mentioning the software versions you used,
in particular the versions of the `SAA`, `musicassessr`, `psychTestR`, and `psychTestRCAT` packages.
You can find these version numbers from R by running the following commands:

```r
library(SAA)
library(psychTestR)
library(psychTestRCAT)
if (!require(devtools)) install.packages("devtools")
x <- devtools::session_info()
x$packages[x$packages$package %in% c("SAA", "psychTestR", "psychTestRCAT"), ]
```
